inspec-CIS-level5
===================

Debian CIS Benchmark level 5 Audit

## Requirements

Of course, inspec installed. If not, use this Ansible Role [redbeard28.chefinspec](https://github.com/redbeard28/ansible-role-chefinspec.git)



## Standalone Usage

This Compliance Profile requires [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) for execution:

```bash
inspec exec https://github.com/redbeard28/inspec-CIS-level5
```

You can also execute the profile directly from Github:

```
$ inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/ssh-baseline
```
